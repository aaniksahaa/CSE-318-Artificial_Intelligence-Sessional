- alpha beta pruning 
	- i can decide whether to expand my children or not 
	- if i am maximizer and my child has already got a value less than

	- alpha param for max passing his value, beta param for min 
	- one child must first be expanded first 
	- which branches will cut or not -> may appear as questions
