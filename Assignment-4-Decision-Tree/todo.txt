1.

Runs

- for each trainPct - 1 to 99
	- for each (strategy, metric)
		- perform 20 runs
		
So, there will be 2*99*20 runs

CSV

- One CSV containing the info about all runs
	- for each runs
	- add a row containing columns
		- trainPct[1-99], strategy[BEST or TOP_THREE], metric[INFORMATION_GAIN or GINI_IMPURITY], accuracyPct, treeConstructionTime[in millis], nodeCount, treeDepth, buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety
		- the last 6 columns here are the avgDepths of attributes, they are got in the same order as arraylist

2.

Runs

- for one single trainPct = 80
	- for each (strategy, metric)
		- perform 20 runs
		
So, there will be 2*20 runs

CSV

- One CSV containing the info about all runs
	- for each runs
		- for each datapoint
			- add a row with columns
			- trainPct, strategy[BEST or TOP_THREE], metric[INFORMATION_GAIN or GINI_IMPURITY], run, ...(names of attributes of datapoints), actual label in datapoint, classified label

plots

- trainPct vs accuracy
- trainPct vs treeConstructionTime
- tree complexity analysis - tree nodeCount, tree depth
	vs trainPct
- attribute depth boxplot
- box plot of performance over 20 runs for each methods
- confusion matrices (80-20)
- error rate per class
